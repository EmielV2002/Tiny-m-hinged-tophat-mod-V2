**Introduction:**
Hi! Welcome and thank you for choosing my Tiny-m tophat design. Before we start, I must warn you. This design has not been fully tested yet so I can’t guarantee that everything will work as it should. But I’m pretty confident it will because the test prints I made looked promising. If you’ve got questions about the design and BOM you can find me on the CroXY discord server in the Tiny-m channel. Have fun and good luck with your build ; )  


**Bill Of Materials (BOM):**

**Note:**
In the printed parts tab you can find two stl's called corner 1 without rod and corner 2 without rod. You can print these parts in one piece instead of the usual two pieces. Because you can print these as one piece you don't need those steel rods and epoxy any longer. A special thanks to Discord user nehiLo for making this remix.

**Hardware:**
-	4x 5x58mm steel rod (length doesn’t need to be that precise)
-	2x Southco E6-10-301-20 constant torque hinges (printed ones will probably work as well)
-	1 tube epoxy to glue the steel rods into place. 

**Panels:**
-	1x back panel (150 and 190mm versions available)
-	2x side panel 1 (150 and 190mm versions available)
-	2x side panel 2 (150 and 190mm versions available)
-	1x top panel (150 and 190mm versions available)

**Fasteners:**
-	8x   M5x8 BHSC for mounting the hinges to the tophat and hinge body.
-	20x M3x10 or 12mm BHSC for mounting the corner pieces and middle pieces.
-	20x M3 threaded inserts.
-	8x   M5 T-nuts.
-	6x   M5x10 BHSC for mounting the left and right hinge bodies and the panel clips.
-	2x   M5x26 BHSC for mounting the left and right hinges bodies.

**Printed parts:**

**Top half:**
-	1x corner 1 top
-	1x corner 2 top
-	1x corner 1 bottom
-	1x corner 2 bottom
-	2x middle 1
-	2x middle 2
-	8x midclip 1
-	2x cornerclip 1
-	2x cornerclip 2

**Bottom half:**
-	1x right hinge part frame
-	1x left hinge part frame
-	1x back_panel_mount – corner_left_3.5mm
-	1x back_panel_mount – corner_right_3.5mm

**Part 1: tophat**

Step 1: place heat inserts in the holes of corner 1 v3 shortened, middle 2 v3 and middle 1 v3.
Step 2: Using two midclip 1 clips connect corner 1 v3 shortened to middle 2 v3 and middle 1 v3.

Step 3: Place heat inserts in corner 2 v3 shortened and in middle 2 v3.
Step 4: Connect corner 2 v3 shortened to middle 1 v3 using another midclip 1 clip. 
Step 5: Connect corner 2 v3 shortened to middle 2 v3 using another midclip 1 clip.

Step 6: Use epoxy or another glue to glue the metal rods in corner 1 v3 back top and corner 2 v3 back top.

Step 7: Put glue in the holes of corner 1 v3 bottom and corner 2 v3 bottom and place them on corner 1 v3 back top and corner 2 v3 back top.

Step 8: Put heat inserts in the holes of corner 1 v3 back top and corner 2 v3 back top just like you did with corner 1 v3 and corner 2 v3.

Step 9: Connect the two assembled halves together using two more midclip 1’s.

**Part 3: Hinges**
Step 13: Using the M5x8 BHSC screws mount the hinges to the two back corners.

Step 14: Mount the left hinge part frame v3 and right hinge part v3 to the back corners of the frame using two T-nuts and the M5x10 BHSC screws.

Step 15: Use a T-nut and a M5x26 BHSC to mount to secure the hinge part firmly to the frame. DO THIS ON BOTH SIDES!

**Part 4: back panel**
Step 16: Slide the back panel in the dedicated slots in the left and right hinge parts you just installed.

Step 17: Lock the panel in place by screwing the back_panel_mount – corner_right_3.5mm and back_panel_mount – corner_left_3.5mm in place. Use the remaining M5x10 BHSC screws and T-nuts.

**Part 5: final assembly**
Step 18: Using the remaining M5x8 BHSC screws screw the hinges on the left and right corner parts.
